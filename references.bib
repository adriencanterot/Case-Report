	abstract = {Pulmonary Langerhans cell (LC) histiocytosis (PLCH) has unknown cause and is a rare neoplastic disorder characterized by the infiltration of lungs and various organs by bone marrow-derived Langerhans cells with an accompanying strong inflammatory response. These cells carry somatic mutations of
              BRAF
              gene and/or
              NRAS, KRAS
              , and
              MAP2K1
              genes, which cause activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. PLCH occurs predominantly in young smokers, without gender predominance. Lungs might be involved as an isolated organ or as part of a multiorgan disease. High-resolution computed chest tomography plays an outstanding role in PLCH diagnosis. The typical radiological picture of PLCH is the presence of small intralobular nodules, “tree in bud” opacities, cavitated nodules, and thin- and thick-walled cysts, frequently confluent. Histological examination of the lesion and demonstration of characteristic eosinophilic granulomas with the presence of LCs that display antigen CD1a or CD207 in immunohistochemistry are required for definite diagnosis. Smoking cessation is the most important recommendation for PLCH patients, but treatment of progressive PLCH and multisystem disease is based on chemotherapy. Recently, new targeted therapies have been implemented.},

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Rationale:}} Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are widely accepted tools for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer and the initial procedure of choice for staging. Obtaining adequate specimens is key to provide a specific histologic and molecular diagnosis of lung cancer. \textbf{\textit{Objectives:}} To develop practice guidelines on the acquisition and preparation of conventional TBNA and EBUS-TBNA specimens for the diagnosis and molecular testing of (suspected) lung cancer. We hope to improve the global unification of procedure standards, maximize the yield and identify areas for research. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to identify relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline [PubMed and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews)]. \textbf{\textit{Main Results:}} The number of needle aspirations with both conventional TBNA and EBUS-TBNA was found to impact the diagnostic yield, with at least 3 passes needed for optimal performance. Neither needle gauge nor the use of miniforceps, the use of suction or the type of sedation/anesthesia has been found to improve the diagnostic yield for lung cancer. The use of rapid on-site cytology examination does not increase the diagnostic yield. Molecular analysis (i.e. EGFR, KRAS and ALK) can be routinely performed on the majority of cytological samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA and conventional TBNA. There does not appear to be a superior method for specimen preparation (i.e. slide staining, cell blocks or core tissue). It is likely that optimal specimen preparation may vary between institutions depending on the expertise of pathology colleagues.},

	abstract = {Context.—
              The rapid advances in targeted therapies in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) make the optimization and implementation of cytology specimens for molecular testing a priority. Up to 70\% of patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at advanced stages and tissue biopsies often cannot be taken. Although cytology samples provide high-quality material for molecular testing, molecular cytopathology is not yet well known or widely used.
            
            
              Objective.—
              To report the many advances in molecular cytopathology and the suitability and utility of cytology samples in molecular and genetic testing of NSCLC.
            
            
              Data Sources.—
              Data sources comprised published peer-reviewed literature and personal experience of the authors.
            
            
              Conclusions.—
              Molecular testing can be performed on cytologic specimens, especially on direct smears. Rapid on-site evaluation by cytopathologists has improved the adequacy and the management of cytology samples for molecular testing. Mutational profiling of NSCLC using next-generation sequencing can be performed on cytology samples from very small amounts of DNA. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assays on cytology specimens, including stained direct smear, offer some distinct advantages over their histologic counterpart, and are used to detect ALK and ROS1 rearrangements in NSCLC. Cytology specimens allow assessment of the entire tumor cell nucleus, avoiding signal loss from truncation artifacts. The use of cytology samples for assessing programmed death ligand-1 protein expression is currently being developed. Protocols for bisulfite conversion and DNA droplet digital polymerase chain reaction assays have been optimized for cytology smear to investigate aberrant DNA methylation of several NSCLC-related genes.},

Specimens from endobronchial-ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are an alternative source of material for the initial diagnosis of NSCLC, however their usefulness for a complete molecular characterization remains controversial. EBUS-TBNA samples were prospectively tested for several biomarkers by next-generation sequencing (NGS), nCounter, and immunohistochemistry (PD-L1). The primary objectives were to assess the sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA samples for a comprehensive molecular characterization and to compare its performance to the reference standard of biopsy samples. Seventy-two EBUS-TBNA procedures were performed, and 42 NSCLC patients were diagnosed. Among all cytological samples, 92.9\% were successfully genotyped by NGS, 95.2\% by nCounter, and 100\% by immunohistochemistry. There were 29 paired biopsy samples; 79.3\% samples had enough tumor material for genomic genotyping, and 96.6\% for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. A good concordance was found between both sources of material: 88.9\% for PD-L1, 100\% for NGS and nCounter. EBUS-TBNA is a feasible alternative source of material for NSCLC genotyping and allows the identification of patient candidates for personalized therapies with high concordance when compared with biopsy.},

	abstract = {Background
              Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is an accurate outpatient procedure used to explore mediastinal lymph nodes for lung cancer staging and unexplained mediastinal masses.
            
            
              Aims and methods
              A retrospective study was conducted over four years on EBUS-TBNA sampled lymph nodes investigated for the staging of lung cancer or unexplained mediastinal lymphadenopathies, first using the conventional method (CM) and then a liquid based cytology (LBC).
            
            
              Results
              Of the 628 specimens (355 patients) collected, the overall rate of adequacy was 88\% and the diagnosis of malignancy was achieved in 43\% of cases. The inadequate rate was 6\% with LBC and 21\% with CM. A paraffin cytoblock was available in 80\% with LBC and 62\% with CM. Of the 628 aspirates, 270 (43\%) were categorised as negative for malignancy including 26 cases consistent with sarcoidosis, 272 (43\%) as malignant, 9 (1.4\%) as suspicious for non-small-cell carcinoma and 77 as inadequate samples (12\%). Of the 272 cases diagnosed as malignant, 87 (32\%) were classified as non-small-cell carcinoma, 106 (39\%) as adenocarcinoma, 48 (18\%) as squamous cell carcinoma and 20 (7\%) as small cell carcinoma. Five lymphomas, four metastatic melanomas and two carcinoids were also diagnosed.
            
            
              Conclusions
              EBUS-TBNA is a reliable method for the staging of lung cancer and for unexplained mediastinal mass exploration. The LBC has a lower rate of inadequate samples, a better yield of cytoblock for immunohistochemistry and a dramatically reduced time requirement for interpretation as compared to CM.},

Obtaining adequate specimens is key to provide a specific histologic and molecular diagnosis of lung cancer. \textbf{\textit{Objectives:}} To develop practice guidelines on the acquisition and preparation of conventional TBNA and EBUS-TBNA specimens for the diagnosis and molecular testing of (suspected) lung cancer. We hope to improve the global unification of procedure standards, maximize the yield and identify areas for research. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to identify relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline [PubMed and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews)]. \textbf{\textit{Main Results:}} The number of needle aspirations with both conventional TBNA and EBUS-TBNA was found to impact the diagnostic yield, with at least 3 passes needed for optimal performance. Neither needle gauge nor the use of miniforceps, the use of suction or the type of sedation/anesthesia has been found to improve the diagnostic yield for lung cancer. The use of rapid on-site cytology examination does not increase the diagnostic yield. Molecular analysis (i.e. EGFR, KRAS and ALK) can be routinely performed on the majority of cytological samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA and conventional TBNA. There does not appear to be a superior method for specimen preparation (i.e. slide staining, cell blocks or core tissue). It is likely that optimal specimen preparation may vary between institutions depending on the expertise of pathology colleagues.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Immunotherapy is being used for the past five years either as first line or second line treatment with great results. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been also used as combination to immunotherapy to further enhance this type of treatment. Intratumoral treatment has been previously proposed as a treatment option for certain non-small cell lung cancer patients., Patients and Methods: We recruited in total seventy four patients with non-small cell lung cancer in their second line treatment who received only chemotherapy in their first line treatment with programmed death-ligand-1 ≤ 50. Only adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and all negative for epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase-1 and proto-oncogene B-Raf. Data were first examined with descriptive statistics choosing frequencies for categorical variables and histograms for the continuous ones. Twenty five received only intravenous immunotherapy and forty-nine intravenous cisplatin with immunotherapy. Data were first examined with descriptive statistics choosing frequencies for categorical variables and histograms for the continuous ones., Results: The relationships between changes of performance status and disease progression were examined via a single correspondence analysis. The two-dimensional scores (coordinates) derived from the correspondence analysis were then regressed against the predictors to form distinct splits and nodes obtaining quantitative results. The best fit is usually achieved by lowering exhaustively the AICc criterion and looking in parallel the change of R2 expecting improvements more than 5\%. both types of therapy are capable of producing best ameliorative effects, when either the programmed death-ligand-1 expression or parenchymal site in joint with low pack years are present in the sampling data., Conclusions: Intratumoral treatment combination with cisplatin plus immunotherapy indifferent of nivolumab or pembrolizumab combination is an effective choice. In specific for those with endobronchial lesions. Moreover; patients with programmed death-ligand-1 ≥ 50 had their performance status and disease progression improved over the eight month observation.},
